## Important Notes 🛡️

### Security and Data Protection
Please note that the evaluation sheets are no longer hosted on GitHub but on a secure, separate server. This change has been made to protect the image rights of 42 Network and ensure the confidentiality of all data. Only authorized individuals can access and contribute to the sheets, safeguarding the integrity and privacy of the information.

### Platform Usage
42Evals is intended as a **supplementary tool** and should not be used as an official source for project evaluations. It provides students with an opportunity to verify their projects before official submission, but the accuracy of the data cannot be guaranteed. This platform is designed to assist, not to replace, the official evaluation processes at 42 School.
