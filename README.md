# 42 Project Evaluation Sheets Hub 🎯

## **This project is no longer active.**

It is with great regret that I announce the closure of this repository due to a decision made by 42 School. As of now, the project is no longer being updated, and all evaluation sheets are permanently unavailable. 

This repository was created with the sole intention of helping students at 42 School prepare for their evaluations by providing resources to self-assess and refine their projects. Unfortunately, due to recent changes in policies and copyright regulations, the project cannot continue to operate. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Thank you to everyone who supported this project and helped improve it over the years. Your contributions and enthusiasm made it what it was.
